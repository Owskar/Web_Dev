            <h2>HTML Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web
                pages. It provides a set of tags and attributes that define the various elements of a webpage such as
                headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render
                the content and layout of a webpage. With HTML, web developers can create structured documents that are
                accessible and readable by both humans and machines, forming the backbone of the World Wide Web.</p>

            <h2>CSS Basics</h2>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                written in HTML or XML. It allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual
                aspects of a webpage. By separating the content from its presentation, CSS enables the creation of
                consistent and visually appealing designs across different devices and screen sizes. CSS uses selectors
                to target specific HTML elements and applies styling rules to them, providing flexibility and
                customization options for web designers.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript Essentials</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language commonly used to create interactive and dynamic
                functionality on web pages. Originally developed for web browsers, JavaScript is now widely used in both
                frontend and backend development. With JavaScript, web developers can manipulate the content of a
                webpage, respond to user interactions, validate form inputs, and communicate with web servers
                asynchronously. JavaScript is an essential tool for creating modern web applications that deliver rich
                user experiences and perform complex tasks seamlessly..</p>
